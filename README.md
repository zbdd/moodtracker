Moodtracker
=========
Software under development

Moodtracker is a simple Android application that lists a series of MoodEntries, separated by FilterViews (Today, Last Week...Years Ago)

MoodEntries are collections of input from an end-user to record their mood at a specific date and time. Optional attributes include
activities, feelings and soon to be implemented: sleep quality and a medication check
